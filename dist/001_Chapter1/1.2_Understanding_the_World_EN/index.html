<!-- Chart placeholder: [1.2 Seeing the World—Building a Macro Perspective for Investing] -->
<p>After deepening self-awareness, investors must broaden their horizons and develop a comprehensive understanding of the external world. Investment decisions are never made in isolation; they are influenced by the macroeconomic environment…, social change, and technological development. Only by establishing a clear, systematic “worldview” can one truly see markets and trends, and thereby accurately capture the investment opportunities presented by the times.</p>
<p>Socrates once reminded humanity: “The only true wisdom is in knowing that you know nothing.” This holds especially true in investing. Faced with rapidly changing markets, investors must continually learn and expand their cognitive boundaries in order to grasp certainty amid uncertainty.</p>
<h3 id="121-theoretical-learning-framework">1.2.1 Theoretical Learning Framework</h3>
<p>In a complex market environment, we first need to build a systematic theoretical framework that covers macroeconomic analysis, industry trend research, company fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and social &#x26; technological trend studies. Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Macroeconomic Theory and Analytical Framework</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Cycle Theory</strong>: Study in-depth the four stages of the economic cycle (expansion, peak, contraction, trough), understand each stage’s characteristics and key macro indicators (GDP growth, inflation rate, unemployment rate), and grasp the interactions between different asset classes and the business cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>…</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Conduct at least one in-depth study of a classic investment case each month. For example, analyze the historical performance of growth or cyclical stocks like Tesla, NVIDIA, Apple, etc., and deeply understand the market factors, industry background, and technological breakthroughs driving their success or failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building a Personal Investment Knowledge System</strong>:<br>
Use knowledge management tools (e.g., Notion, Obsidian, Evernote) to create an investment knowledge base. Organize insights on macro, industry, corporate fundamentals, technical analysis, and market sentiment, gradually refining your system for quick retrieval and practical application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simulated Trading and Real-time Practice</strong>:<br>
Use simulation tools (e.g., TradingView Paper Trading) for weekly practice, test theoretical analyses in real time, and gradually improve market sensitivity and trading skills, laying a solid foundation for real-market operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reading Guide</strong>: See Chapter 10 “Trade Execution and Practical Guide,” Section 10.4 “Research Reports and Trading Plan Templates,” and specific stock analysis cases in “U.S. Stock Investment Manual III: Equity Research &#x26; Practical Records.”</p>
<p>By using these methods, investors can transform theoretical learning into effective practice cognition, gradually gaining proactive control and competitive advantage in a complex market. Investing is not just about analysis; it’s also about building a long-term, systematic cognitive framework and practical skills. Once you master the ability to “see the world,” investing becomes an art of harnessing uncertainty with wisdom.</p>
