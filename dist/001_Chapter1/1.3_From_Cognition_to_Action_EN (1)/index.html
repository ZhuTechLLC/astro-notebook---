<!-- Chart placeholder: [1.3 From Cognition to Action—Building a Systematic Investment Framework] -->
<p>After knowing yourself and understanding the world, the next step for investors is to efficiently turn insights into action. Investment success relies not only on knowledge accumulation and information analysis but also on effective execution. As Charlie Munger emphasized, “A good investment system is like a high-quality operating system, enabling precise and efficient action amid uncertainty.”</p>
<p>This section details how to systematically construct a personalized investment action framework, linking to subsequent chapters of the practical manual to provide clear guidance for investors.</p>
<h3 id="131-define-investment-goals-and-strategy-positioning">1.3.1 Define Investment Goals and Strategy Positioning</h3>
<p>Clear and specific investment goals and strategy positioning form the first step of the action framework. Goals must be quantified and actionable to ensure every decision has a clear basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Quantify Return Targets and Risk Controls</strong>: Before entering the market, investors must set clear expected returns (e.g., 15–20% annualized) and risk limits (e.g., maximum drawdown no greater than 8%). Precise definition of targets and risk tolerance clarifies the risk-reward profile of each investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify Personal Investment Style and Strategy Path</strong>: Based on individual personality, financial situation, and investment horizon, choose a suitable style—value investing, growth investing, momentum trading, etc. Define your style and corresponding strategies (long-term holding, cyclical trading, event-driven transactions).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>…</p>
<p>Investment frameworks must ultimately integrate personalization and practicality to ensure sustainable implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Customization of Risk Tolerance and Decision Style</strong>: Tailor risk management and style configuration according to personal finances, age, and family situation to ensure both effectiveness and comfort in execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration of Modern Investment Tools</strong>: Actively use support platforms (GuruFocus, Morningstar, TradingView, etc.) to enhance information access, data analysis, and decision efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building Intelligent Trading Systems and Algorithmic Assistance</strong>: With the development of AI and big data, investors can explore intelligent trading bots for efficient signal capture, execution, and risk management, reducing emotional bias.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reading Guide</strong>: Detailed development and application of intelligent trading systems are covered in “U.S. Stock Investment Manual V: Quantitative Topics.”</p>
<p>Investment success arises from the deep integration of insightful cognition, systematic methodology, and disciplined execution. When you build a complete framework from self-awareness through world insight to actionable implementation, investing truly becomes sustainable, rational behavior. As Warren Buffett said, “The secret to investing success is clear methods, defined rules, and strict discipline.”</p>
<p>We hope this action framework and its detailed guidance help investors bridge theory and practice, ultimately achieving continuous wealth growth and financial freedom.</p>
