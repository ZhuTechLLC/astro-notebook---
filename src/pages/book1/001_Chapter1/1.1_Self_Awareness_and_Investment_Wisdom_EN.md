<!-- Chart placeholder: [1.1 Self-Awareness and the Starting Point of Investment Wisdom] -->

### 1.1.1 Knowing Yourself

The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates inscribed the maxim "Know Thyself" on a pillar at the Temple of Delphi. For millennia, this simple yet profound statement has guided seekers of wisdom. With scientific revelations about the brain's cognitive mechanisms, self-awareness has become an essential foundation for understanding the world and mastering one's life. This wisdom is especially important in the complex and uncertain realm of investing.

Human self-awareness first emerged in philosophy. Though separated by vast distances, Eastern and Western sages converged on the importance of inner awareness:

- In ancient Greece, Socrates declared, "The unexamined life is not worth living," and Plato further proposed a tripartite soul theory, emphasizing that reason should govern emotion and desire—an inner balance that mirrors the interplay of rationality and emotion in investment decisions.

- In Eastern thought, the Daoist Laozi taught, "Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is enlightenment," and advocated "the highest good is like water," urging alignment with natural patterns. In investing, this translates to respecting market trends and avoiding fighting against prevailing forces.
