The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates inscribed the maxim "Know Thyself" on a pillar at the Temple of Delphi. For millennia, this simple yet profound statement has guided seekers of wisdom. With scientific revelations about the brain's cognitive mechanisms, self-awareness has become an essential foundation for understanding the world and mastering one's life. This wisdom is especially important in the complex and uncertain realm of investing.

Human self-awareness first emerged in philosophy. Though separated by vast distances, Eastern and Western sages converged on the importance of inner awareness:

- In ancient Greece, Socrates declared, "The unexamined life is not worth living," and Plato further proposed a tripartite soul theory, emphasizing that reason should govern emotion and desire—an inner balance that mirrors the interplay of rationality and emotion in investment decisions.
